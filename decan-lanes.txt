Decan Card Annotation Lanes
===========================

Each decan pip card has a vertical scale from 0° to 10° on the left edge,
with tick marks at each degree. Information is arranged in vertical lanes
from left to right.

LEFT LANES (reading upward along the decan scale)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lane 0: Degree ticks (0–1mm from left edge)
Lane 1: Monomoiria — Chaldean planetary ruler for each degree (0.5mm, 4pt symbol font)
Lane 2: Egyptian bounds — planet symbol in a thin black-outlined square (\boundsquare, 5pt, anchor=south west at 2.5mm). One square per bound transition.
Lane 3: Manzil — Kufi Arabic letter in a thin circle (\manzillane, 5pt, anchor=south west at 5mm). Anchored at the bottom of each manzil span.
Lane 4: Nakṣatra pādas — Devanagari syllable in a thin circle (\padasyllable, 5pt, anchor=south west at 9mm). Anchored at the bottom of each pāda span.
Lane 5: Xiù — CJK character in a thin circle (\xiulane, 5pt, anchor=south west at 12.5mm). Anchored at the bottom of each xiù span.

MIDDLE: Fixed stars, other boundary annotations as needed.

RIGHT LANES (rotated 90° CCW, reading bottom-to-top)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lane R1: Hexagrams — I Ching hexagram with pinyin above and English below (\cardwidth-17mm on 2W, \cardwidth-14mm default)
Lane R2: Solar terms — rotated label: CJK + pinyin + English (5pt, \cardwidth-11mm). One per decan, anchored at 0°.
Lane R3: Microseasons (pentads/hòu) — rotated label: CJK + pinyin + English (4pt, \cardwidth-9mm). Anchored at their degree position. Typically 2 per decan.

BOUNDARY START MARKERS
─────────────────────
When a division system begins on a card, an annotation is placed to the
right of its circle/square:

Nakṣatra start (\nakshatrastart): ordinal number right of the first pāda
  circle. If a rāśi also starts at the same degree, the rāśi symbol +
  Devanagari + romanization follow. This only happens on 3 cards (4W, 7W,
  10W) because rāśi-nakṣatra coincidences occur every 120° sidereal,
  which is the fire trine (Aries/Leo/Sagittarius = Wands).

Rāśi start (\rashistart — TBD): The remaining 9 rāśi boundaries do NOT
  coincide with nakṣatra boundaries. These need a separate rendering,
  attached to the pāda circle at the rāśi boundary degree. All 12 rāśi
  boundaries fall at 4.267° in a 3rd decan (24°16' of each sign):
    Meṣa (4W*)  Vṛṣabha (7P)  Mithuna (10S)  Karka (4C)
    Siṃha (7W*) Kanyā (10P)   Tulā (4S)      Vṛścika (7C)
    Dhanu (10W*) Makara (4P)   Kumbha (7S)    Mīna (10C)
  * = coincides with nakṣatra start, handled by \nakshatrastart

Cì start (\cistart): CJK name with pinyin above + squished English gloss,
  attached right of the xiù ordinal number at the cì boundary.

Manzil start: ordinal number right of the Kufi circle, with optional
  TikZ keys for nudging when crowded.

Xiù ordinal: number right of the CJK circle.

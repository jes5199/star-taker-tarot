Decan Card Annotation Lanes
===========================

Each decan pip card has a vertical scale from 0° to 10° on the left edge,
with tick marks at each degree. Information is arranged in vertical lanes
from left to right.

LEFT LANES (reading upward along the decan scale)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lane 0: Degree ticks (0–1mm from left edge)
Lane 1: Monomoiria — Chaldean planetary ruler for each degree (0.5mm, 4pt symbol font)
Lane 2: Egyptian bounds — planet symbol in a thin black-outlined square (\boundsquare, 5pt, anchor=south west at 2.5mm). One square per bound transition.
Lane 3: Manzil — reserved for a single Arabic letter. ~5–7mm. (Not yet implemented; empty if no manzil on that card.)
Lane 4: Nakṣatra pādas — Devanagari syllable in a thin circle (\padasyllable, 5pt, anchor=south west at 7.5mm). Anchored at the bottom of each pāda span.
Lane 5: Xiù — CJK character in a thin circle (\xiulane, 5pt, anchor=south west at 11mm). Anchored at the bottom of each xiù span.

MIDDLE: Fixed stars, other boundary annotations as needed.

RIGHT LANES (rotated 90° CCW, reading bottom-to-top)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lane R1: Hexagrams — I Ching hexagram with pinyin above and English below (\cardwidth-17mm on 2W, \cardwidth-14mm default)
Lane R2: Solar terms — rotated label: CJK + pinyin + English (5pt, \cardwidth-11mm). One per decan, anchored at 0°.
Lane R3: Microseasons (pentads/hòu) — rotated label: CJK + pinyin + English (4pt, \cardwidth-9mm). Anchored at their degree position. Typically 2 per decan.
